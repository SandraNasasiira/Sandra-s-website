                    <h5> Blog1: Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage. Trevor Noah in Born a Crime</h5>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>From the beginning of the novel, I find Trevor's mother an independent hardworking woman who does not need a man to survive.So,with the above statement I really feel that is true Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife and not Patricia,Noah's mother. </p>
                    <p>In other words, Patricia wasn't the right woman because she never believed in tradition and never wanted to be ruled by a man.All her life she had lived a life of struggling to make ends meet and therefore she had no signs of being a submissive house wife.</p>
                    <p>Further in the novel,after their marriage, the couple encounters a lot of miss understandings where Abel starts drinking alcohol,landing the family in trouble like attempting to burn the kitchen due to being drunk  </p>
                    <p>The situation worsens when Abel starts beating Patricia and Trevor who are helpless because the police fails to help since they are friends with Abel and as we see at the end,they are totally separated with a tragical incident where by Abel shoots at Patricia for having left him for another man with his kids.</p>
                    <p>I feel like if the two had not gotten married,Trevor Noah's mother would not have suffered the way she did with Abel and Abel too wouldn't have felt that his wife was not respecting him even when she did nothing to disrespect him.
                        I still say,had Abel married a traditional wife,he would get the respect he deserved and he wouldn't have to demand it from Patricia the way he did. </p>

                    <h5>Blog 2:
                        Evaluate Noah’s use of humor to explain various instances in his life throughout the book. Discuss the overall impact of using humor, focusing on how humor enabled him to make friends and to get out of difficult situations. In this discussion, pinpoint certain words and phrases Noah uses to support the analysis of the use of humor.</h5>
                    <p>Throughout the novel, Trevor Noah uses humour to describe different situations and uses it to make friends and come out of different situations</p>
                    <p>Trevor Noah uses humour to describe his conversation with his mom where she's describing what she was expecting from him after giving birth to him and and it turns out that she did not get what she wanted.This is found on page 77"My mother used to tell me,"I chose to have you because I wanted something to love and something to love me unconditionally in return-then I gave birth to the most selfish piece of shit on earth and all it ever did was cry and eat and shit and say 'me me,me,me'. I find the mother's speech humorous </p>
                    <p>He goes on to present his birth in a humorous way on page 26,line 25-28 He says"The doctors  took her up to the delivery room,cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white,half black child who violated any number of laws,statutes,and regulations.I was born a crime.This already shows the reader, the circumstances under which he was born and describes the process through which he came out of the mother's bell.I find it funny that he says his mother's belly was cut open.Like seriously that process had a special name but he chose to use that sentence so as to make everyone understand.  </p>
                    <p>I also find humor on page36,where he shows how his mother would warn him not to eat anything at his grandfather's place because she was afraid of being poisoned by her step mother.Trevor would insist and he went a head and told the mom that"Okay,then why don't I just pray to jesus and Jesus would take away the poison?"After being yelled at he left the food and this saved his life in one way or the other. </p>
                    <p>Humor also saves Trevor when he shits on a piece of paper in the kitchen all in the name of saving himself from being hit by the rain.He however describes the situation as a powerful experience and talks more on it.page 43  </p>
                    <p>He uses humor to defend himself in front of God and at the same time to save himself from the mother's rage when he gives a prayer during the shit incident."Dear Lord,please protect us,um,you know from whoever did this but,but like,we don't know what happened exactly and maybe it was a big misunderstanding and, you, know,maybe we shouldn't be quick to judge when we don't know the story and,I mean of course you know best,Heavenly father,but maybe this time it wasn't actually a demon,because who can say for certain,so maybe cut whoever it was a break...." </p>
